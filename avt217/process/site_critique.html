<h4>Navigation</h4>

	<p>The website was super easy and efficant to navigate with the home page having a rotating window for promotions and to join the mailing list and a live feed of the store. As well as all the other sub pages at the top that make it feel very complete. Although you can not tell because I didn't was the rest of the webpage but the width of the webpage doesn't fit in a full screen layout. as there is a lot of empty space on the right and left sides of the webpage. </p>
<h4>Usability</h4>
	<img src="images-screetshot/1home.png" width="823" height="718" alt=""/>
<p>The interface of the webpage is super intuitive that allows it to be easy to follow, with it having a page for anything and everything you would need to know about them from ordering to frequently asked questions and even news about them. The whole site is extremly legible but maybe having the fonts being a bit larger and bold would help it be a bit easier to read as fonts they use are rather thin and narrow.</p>
	
	<h4>Typography and hierarchy</h4>
	<img src="images-screetshot/3about.png" width="980" height="1436" alt=""/>
<p>The typography of the whole website fits the sort of clean and cheerful asthetic the website was going for. The only think that it is missing is having another font style as it is all sans serif down to the logo and headings. </p>
	
	<h4>Overall style/look and feel</h4>
	<img src="images-screetshot/final1.png" width="1004" height="799" alt=""/>
	<p>The overall vibe of the website is very sweet and cheerfull with many of the pages heading featuring the signiture cupcakes as well as their shade of pink. It is very clean and minimalistic which fits the image they are trying to portray of being a more upscale world renound bakery. It complety fits their idenity to a tee and their isn't much I would change aside from the addition of another font and having the website fill thw whole screen while in desktop mode and fullscreened. </p>
